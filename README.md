# Deep Learning Model for Speech to Plant's Diseased-Image Generation.
 
In the agricultural sector, there is always a need to correctly identify plants, seeds, and pesticides for actively growing crops in farming. But due to a lack of knowledge and resources, misiudgment can cause significant effects like a waste of resources and a reduction in production. The idea is to build a deep learning-assisted system such that the farmer will give a plant description in audio format as input and the input will be a diseased leaf of the mentioned plant.
